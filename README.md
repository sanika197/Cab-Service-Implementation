# Cab-Service-Implementation
DSA based mini-project. Data Structures used: Graph, Tree, Linked list, Array. Algorithm used: Djkstra's Algorithm.

Used Graph data structure to store the locations at vertices and connect them using edges. 
Using Djkstra's algorithm one can get shortest distance and the corresponding shortest path from the pick up point to destination point. 
Decision tree is implemented for the purpose of allocating a cab to user based on number of passengers and availablity of cab at that position.
Performing delete and insert operations on linked list to make driver available at destination location and unavailable from earlier location.

Cab Service Implementation provides facilities to 3 types of end users:
1. Admin
2. Drivers
3. Passenger

Admin privileges:
1. Get to know profit incurred, total revenue generated and monitoring total expenses on daily basis.
2. Managing wage rate for drivers
3. Analyzing which location incurred maximum revenue.

Driver functionalities:
1. Registration
2. Get to know wages
3. Automatic allocation based on location of service and cab type

Passenger:
1. Registration
2. Booking a ride
3. Getting to choose car type based on it's availablity
4. Instant bill generation

Further Scope:
1. Cancellation of ride feature
2. Getting feedback from passenger
